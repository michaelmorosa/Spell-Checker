# Spell-Checker
This program uses a trie data structure, a txt file of correctly spelled words, and a csv file of incorrectly and correctly spelled words. The goal is to find the incorrectly spelled word. If the word differs zero or 1 letters, then we count it spelled correctly. If not, then it is marked incorrect.
